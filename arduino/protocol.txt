Arduino Protocol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes the protocol used by the python server to communicate
with the arduino. This protocol consists of a set of simple commands sent over
the top of the serial connection between the PC and arduino.

Note that each charecter is sent as ascii codes. Hence each command will be a
set number of bytes in length.

Every command is terminated by an underscore charecter '_'

Commands
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HELLO_
Very simple command that echos hello back on the serial port and initialises
a connection with the host computer.

CLOSE_
Another simple command telling the arduino that the host is going to close the
serial connection.

GTXXX_ - GO TO XXX
This command moves the servo directly too the angle specified in XXX. XXX can
be any number in the range 0 to 180. Sent as 6 bytes in total.
Examples:
    71 84 48 48 48 48 95 - moves the arm to position 0
    71 84 48 48 57 48 95 - moves the arm to position 90
    71 84 48 49 45 48 95 - moves the arm to position 170
